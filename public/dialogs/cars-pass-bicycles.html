          <h2>Cars Pass Bicycles </h2>
          <div>
            Cars pass the bicycles using the center turn lane.  
            Using the center lane is dangerous because oncoming cars passing from the other 
            side may be met head on. <br/>
            California law requires cars to give bicycles 3 feet of clearance when passing.
            California vehicle code states the center turn lane may only be used for turning and not passing.
